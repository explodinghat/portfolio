# portfolio
- Portfolio of practical work, exercises from tutorial courses, etc

- Highlights a small selection of knowledge across various technologies

- All scripts/ items are presented as open-source and with company/customer specific information removed (where appropriate). This does mean some scripts will not work without some editing. I encourage anyone with the time (or patience) to fork this repo and make any tweaks or edits as required, and you are welcome also to use the scripts within in your own work if you feel they will be of any use.
